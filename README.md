## 📊 Overview
RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique used in data analytics to group customers based on:
- **Recency** – how recently they made a purchase  
- **Frequency** – how often they buy  
- **Monetary** – how much they spend  
This helps in identifying high-value and low-value customer groups. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
